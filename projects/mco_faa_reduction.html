            <h1>FAA Schedule Reductions at MCO</h1>
            <h4>November 6th, 2025</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
                On November 5th, 2025, the Federal Aviation Administration announced 
                mandated nationwide air traffic schedule reductions from all of the nation's air
                carriers as a result of the continued federal government shutdown. With staffing 
                levels at critical ATC facilities stretched thin, the agency is requiring airlines to 
                proactively cut flights at 40 airports across the nation.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Orlando International Airport (IATA: MCO) is among the airports on the list provided by
                the agency. Beginning Friday November 7th, airlines at MCO are expected to start cancelling 
                flights in response to FAA scheduling constraints. This is ahead of a busy travel season for
                both Thanksgiving travel and start of the overall holiday bank of seasonal demand.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Below is a continuously updated list of all flights cancelled at MCO since 
                November 6th through the next 3 days from today. This list will remain active and grow 
                for as long as the federal government shutdown continues or until the FAA 
                officially lifts its mandate to reduce flight schedules.
              </p>
