            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
            Hello! My name is Dariel. Right now, I am attending The University of Chicago as an Odyssey Scholar, double majoring in Public Policy and Data Science. Additionally, I am a part of the selective Public Policy Leaders Program, a three-year program for students who are ambitious about pursuing careers in policy. Prior to studying at The University of Chicago, I graduated with honors from Valencia College with an Associate's Degree through a dual enrollment program in high school.
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout my early career, I have made myself a force to be reckoned with. After high school, I had a brief stint in the politics scene, working on local school board campaigns and ballot initiatives in my home state of Florida. Now in college, I work on large data sets to understand how policy impacts people specifically when it comes to transportation.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm the President of <a href="transit.rso.uchicago.edu">UChicago Transit Enthusiasts</a>, which takes up most of my time when not in the classroom. I brought the organization from a small informal bunch of transit geeks into a thriving recognized student organization boasting over 150 members from graduate and undergraduate groups at the University. Through the organization, I've had the opportunity to work on many transportation data analysis projects, which you can learn more about on <a href="/projects.html">my projects page</a>.
